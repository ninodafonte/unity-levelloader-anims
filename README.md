# ðŸŽ¬ Unity Library for animations between scene switching
Level Loader adds animations for fade in/fade out to your project, making the transitions between scenes cool and pleasant ðŸ’œ

## Credits

The code for the level loader and the anims comes from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE9VOZivb3I), created by the one and only [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys).
